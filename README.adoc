After a fresh install of RHEL, these files configure the new host. 

== run

. Install RHEL on host2.
. Log into host2. My user account is fine, the Ansible playbook will ask for the root password.
. Download and run this script
```
curl -o - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nickhardiman/machine-host2/main/machine-host2-configure.sh | bash -x
```

== what is host2

Host2 is one of the PCs in my home lab.
It hosts a bunch of VMs (virtual machines). 
The physical machine host2 will be described in mind-numbing detail at https://hardiman.consulting/, assuming I ever have free time ever again.

```
my workstation --> host2 <-- GitHub 
```

* machine-host2-configure.sh: the shell script to kick off the setup process, run on host2.
* Ansible playbook for host2, run by the script: machine-host2-configure.yml 
* shell script to run on my workstation: machine-workstation-configure.sh

== todo

Way too much.
